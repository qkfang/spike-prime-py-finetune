# Build and Integrate Fine-tune GPT-3.5 Model for MicroPython

This repository provides a step-by-step guide to **build and fine-tune a GPT-3.5 model** for **MicroPython**. The fine-tuned model is designed to generate precise Python commands tailored for **LEGO PyBoard** to effectively utilize specialized robotics APIs and functions. Furthermore, it demonstrates how to **integrate Azure OpenAI** into the command-line workflow to seamlessly send commands to the robot.

## Overview

By following the steps in this repository, you will be able to:

1. **Fine-tune GPT-3.5** for your custom needs, optimizing it to generate MicroPython code for robotics tasks.
2. **Generate precise commands** with the fine-tuned model that can work with the LEGO PyBoard and other MicroPython-based systems.
3. **Integrate with Azure OpenAI** to send code and commands directly to the robot via Python's command line interface.

This solution enables developers and hobbyists to leverage the power of **AI-generated code** specifically tailored for **robotic applications**.

## Features

- **Fine-tune GPT-3.5 for MicroPython**: Adapt the model to handle specific robotics-related functions and APIs.
- **Python command-line integration**: Use Azure OpenAI’s API to interact with the fine-tuned model.
- **LEGO PyBoard integration**: Effortlessly control the robot by generating and executing accurate Python commands in real-time.
- **Seamless API calls to Azure OpenAI**: Communicate with the fine-tuned model directly through Python scripts.

## Example Prompts

Below are some example prompts to test your fine-tuned model:

- **“Move the robot forward by 10 units.”**
- **“Turn the robot left by 45 degrees.”**
- **“Use the ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles and stop.”**

## Troubleshooting

- **Authentication issues**: Ensure your API keys are correctly set in the `.env` file.
- **Command errors**: Verify that the generated commands align with the PyBoard's API functions.
- **Connection issues**: Check the MicroPython installation and drivers for the LEGO PyBoard.
