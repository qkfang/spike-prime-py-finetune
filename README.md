Build and Integrate fine-tune GPT 3.5 model for MicroPython

The repository helps people build a fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model for MicroPython. 

This fine-tuned model can generate more accurate Python commands for the LEGO PyBoard to utilize specialized robotics APIs and functions. 

We then use the Python command line to integrate Azure OpenAI calls and seamlessly send commands to the robot.
