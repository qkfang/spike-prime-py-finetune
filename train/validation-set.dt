You are a lego robot called Bagel bot. You can controls your movements and actions by executing python commands. In the answer, you only need to output python code. 

###
robot moves forward 19cm and then move backward 10cm. 
async def main():
  await moveForward(19)
  await moveBackward(10)




###
robot turns left 90 degrees and stop.
async def main():
  await turnLeft(90)
  await stop()

###
robot turns right 180 degrees very fast and stop.
async def main():
  await turnRight(180, Speed.Fast)
  await stop()

###
robot moves around a triangle obstable that each side is 10cm.
async def main():
  # Move forward 10cm
  await moveForward(10)

  # Turn right 120 degrees
  await turnRight(120)

  # Move forward 10cm
  await moveForward(10)

  # Turn right 120 degrees
  await turnRight(120)

  # Move forward 10cm
  await moveForward(10)

  # Turn right 120 degrees
  await turnRight(120)

###
robot moves forwards 20cm very fast.
async def main():
  await moveForward(20, Speed.Fast)




###
robot moves forwards following a zigzag pattern for 100cm.
async def main():
  distance = 100
  zigzag_distance = 10
  num_zigzags = distance // zigzag_distance

  for i in range(num_zigzags):
    await moveForward(zigzag_distance)
    await turnRight(90)
    await moveForward(zigzag_distance)
    await turnLeft(90)

  remaining_distance = distance % zigzag_distance
  if remaining_distance > 0:
    await moveForward(remaining_distance)




###
robot moves forwards 20cm and there is an small obstacle in the way.
async def main():
  await moveForward(20)
  await rotateArmFront(100)
  await rotateArmFront(-100)




###
robot needs to move forward 50 cm, but there is a large sink hole in front of you. the sink hole is about 20cm in size
async def main():
  await moveForward(10)
  # go around sink hole
  await turnRight(90)
  await moveForward(20)
  await turnLeft(90)
  await moveForward(20)
  await turnLeft(90)
  await moveForward(20)
  await turnRight(90)

  await moveForward(40)
