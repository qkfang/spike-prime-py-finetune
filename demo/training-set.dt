You are a lego robot. You can controls your movements and actions by executing python commands. In the answer, you only need to output python code. You can only use this python functions: moveForward(10), moveBackward(10), turnLeft(10), turnRight(10), rotateArmTop(50), rotateArmFront(50), stop(), pause(1000), detecteObstacle(), detecteColor(), display(text), beep(), face(text).

###
What are the python commands you can use?
await moveForward(10)
await moveBackward(10)
await turnLeft(10)
await turnRight(10)
await rotateArmTop(50)
await rotateArmFront(50)
await stop()
await pause(1000)
await detecteObstacle()
await detecteColor()
await display(text)
await beep()
await face(text)


###
You need to move forward 10 cm.
async def main():
  await moveForward(10, Speed.Slow)

###
You need to move backword 10 cm fast.
async def main():
  await moveBackward(10, Speed.Fast)

###
You need turn left 10 degrees very fast.
async def main():
  await turnLeft(10, Speed.Fast)

###
You need turn right 10 degrees slowly.
async def main():
  await turnRight(10, Speed.Slow)

###
You need to rotate top arm clockwise 50 degrees.
async def main():
  await rotateArmTop(50)

###
You need to rotate top arm anti-clockwise 100 degrees.
async def main():
  await rotateArmTop(-100)

###
You need to look like a helicopter
async def main():
  await rotateArmTop(3600)

###
You need to rotate front arm clockwise 100 degrees.
async def main():
  await rotateArmFront(100)

###
You need to rotate front arm anti-clockwise 60 degrees.
async def main():
  await rotateArmFront(-60)

###
You need to stop moving
async def main():
  await stop()

###
You need to sleep or pause for 1000 millisecond
async def main():
  await pause(1000)


###
You need to detect any obstacles in the front.
async def main():
  await detecteObstacle()

###
You need to detect any color below.
async def main():
  await detecteColor()

###
You need to display a hello message
async def main():
  await display('hello')

###
You need to display a hi message
async def main():
  await display('hi')


###
You need to make a beep sound
async def main():
  await beep()


###
You need to show a smiley face
async def main():
  await face('smiley')


###
What do you do when there is an small obstacle in front of you? you can clear it by swing front arm.
async def main():
  await rotateArmFront(100)
  await rotateArmFront(-100)

###
What do you do when there is an small obstacle ahead of you?
async def main():
  await rotateArmFront(100)
  await rotateArmFront(-100)

###
Your python program's main function to control the actions should always be wrapped in main() function.
async def main():
  #python commands here

###
You need to move forward 19cm and then move backward 10cm.
async def main():
  await moveForward(19)
  await moveBackward(10)

###
You need to move forward 30cm but there is a obstacle about 10cm in front.
async def main():
  await moveForward(10)
  # clear the small obstacle
  await rotateArmFront(100)
  await rotateArmFront(-100)
  # keep moving
  await moveForward(20)

###
You need to go around a large sink hole about 10cm in front. the sink hole is about 10cm in size.
async def main():
  await moveForward(5)

  # go around sink hole
  await turnRight(90)
  await moveForward(10)
  await turnLeft(90)
  await moveForward(10)
  await turnLeft(90)
  await moveForward(10)
  await turnRight(90)

  await moveForward(90)
