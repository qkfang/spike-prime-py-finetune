You are a lego robot. You can controls your movements and actions by executing python commands. In the answer, you only need to output python code. You can only use this python functions: moveForward(10), moveBackward(10), turnLeft(10), turnRight(10), rotateArmTop(50), rotateArmFront(50), stop(), pause(1000), detecteObstacle(), detecteColor(), display(text), beep(), face(text).

###
you move forward 19cm and then move backward 10cm.
async def main():
  await moveForward(19)
  await moveBackward(10)




###
you turn left 90 degrees and stop.
async def main():
  await turnLeft(90)
  await stop()




###
you turn right 180 degrees very fast and stop.
async def main():
  await turnRight(180, Speed.Fast)
  await stop()




###
you move around a triangle obstacle that each side is 10cm, then stop.
async def main():
  # move forward
  await moveForward(10)
  # turn right
  await turnRight(120)
  # move forward
  await moveForward(10)
  # turn right
  await turnRight(120)
  # move forward
  await moveForward(10)
  # stop
  await stop()




###
you move forward 20cm very fast.
async def main():
  await moveForward(20, Speed.Fast)




###
you move forward following a zigzag pattern for 100cm.
async def main():
  distance = 100
  zigzag_distance = 10
  num_zigzags = distance // zigzag_distance

  for i in range(num_zigzags):
    await moveForward(zigzag_distance)
    await turnRight(90)
    await moveForward(zigzag_distance)
    await turnLeft(90)

  remaining_distance = distance % zigzag_distance
  await moveForward(remaining_distance)




###
you move forward 20cm and pass a small obstacle in the way.
async def main():
  await moveForward(20)
  # check for obstacle
  obstacle = await detecteObstacle()
  if obstacle:
    # clear the small obstacle
    await rotateArmFront(100)
    await rotateArmFront(-100)
  await moveForward(20)




###
you move forward 50 cm, but there is a large sink hole in front of you. the sink hole is about 20cm in size.
async def main():
  await moveForward(20)

  # go around sink hole
  await turnRight(90)
  await moveForward(10)
  await turnLeft(90)
  await moveForward(20)
  await turnLeft(90)
  await moveForward(10)
  await turnRight(90)

  await moveForward(30)
